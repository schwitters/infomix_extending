Description
-----------
Sample esql/c programs for working with the idn_mrLvarchar type.

This assumes that the table and data have been loaded from
the ../data directory.

Files
-----
   README        This file.
   Makefile      Makefile that builds the programs.
   aesop.ec      Shows how to fetch an idn_mrLvarchar values.
                 Given a regular expression, returns all fables 
                 that match the regular expression.

                 To build:

                    esql -g -o aesop aesop.ec

                 or:

                    make aesop

                 Sample usage that finds all fables that mention a crow
                 or raven (should return 23 rows):

                    aesop <database> "crow|raven"

   equal.ec      Shows how to bind an idn_mrLvarchar value as a host
                 variable in the WHERE clause.

                 To build:

                    esql -g -o equal equal.ec

                 or:
  
                    make equal

                 Sample usage (hard codes the fable it is looking for):

                    equal <database> 

                 Expected output:

                    Title=The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk
                    Found 1 titles that match the fable.
                    Test Complete

   exp_chk.ec    Code included by equal.ec and aesop.ec.
