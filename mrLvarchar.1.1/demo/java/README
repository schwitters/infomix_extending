   Aesop.java                 The main application
   Aesop.class     

   IdnMrLvarchar.java         SQLData interface for the idn_mrLvarchar
   IdnMrLvarchar.class        opaque type. The Aesop class uses this.



Instructions
-------------
First, create and load the aesop table from the ../data directory.

Usage:

    java Aesop 'jdbc:informix-sqli://localhost:1526/your_db:\
           informixserver=ol_pc76 3dl;user=your_user;password=your_pwd'

Once it starts up, you see the following output and get a new prompt:

    Informix JDBC driver loaded.
    Database connection established.
    Enter 'help' (without quotes) to get started.
    your_db>

'help' outputs skeletal information:

    your_db> help

    Enter a regular expression (without quotes) to find a fable that matches.
    For example, this application searches for 'Crow', 'crow', 'Raven', or
    'raven' with the following regular expression:
    
        [Cc]row|[Rr]aven

    Enter 'quit' to exit this application.

'quit' exits the application.
