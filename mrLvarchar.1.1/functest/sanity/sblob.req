'The Thief and the Innkeeper : A THIEF hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the hope of stealing something which should enable him to pay his reckoning.  When he had waited some days in vain, he saw the Innkeeper dressed in a new and handsome coat and sitting before his door.  The Thief sat down beside him and talked with him.  As the conversation began to flag, the Thief yawned terribly and at the same time howled like a wolf.  The Innkeeper said, "Why do you howl so fearfully?''  "I will tell you," said the Thief, "but first let me ask you to hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces.  I know not, sir, when I got this habit of yawning, nor whether these attacks of howling were inflicted on me as a judgment for my crimes, or for any other cause; but this I do know, that when I yawn for the third time, I actually turn into a wolf and attack men."  With this speech he commenced a second fit of yawning and again howled like a wolf, as he had at first.  The Innkeeper.  hearing his tale and believing what he said, became greatly alarmed and, rising from his seat, attempted to run away. The Thief laid hold of his coat and entreated him to stop, saying, "Pray wait, sir, and hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces in my fury, when I turn into a wolf."  At the same moment he yawned the third time and set up a terrible howl.  The Innkeeper, frightened lest he should be attacked, left his new coat in the Thief''s hand and ran as fast as he could into the inn for safety.  The Thief made off with the coat and did not return again to the inn.  (Moral: Every tale is not to be believed.)'

mrcol        A fable by Aesop: The Buffoon and the Countryman : A RICH NOBLEMAN
              once opened the theaters without charge to the people, and gave a
              public notice that he would handsomely reward any person who inve
             nted a new amusement for the occasion. Various public performers c
             ontended for the prize.  Among them came a Buffoon well known amon
             g the populace for his jokes, and said that he had a kind of enter
             tainment which had never been brought out on any stage before.  Th
             is report being spread about made a great stir, and the theater wa
             s crowded in every part. The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platf
             orm, without any apparatus or confederates, and the very sense of 
             expectation caused an intense silence.  He suddenly bent his head 
             towards his bosom and imitated the squeaking of a little pig so ad
             mirably with his voice that the audience declared he had a porker 
             under his cloak, and demanded that it should be shaken out.  When 
             that was done and nothing was found, they cheered the actor, and l
             oaded him with the loudest applause.  A Countryman in the crowd, o
             bserving all that has passed, said, "So help me, Hercules, he shal
             l not beat me at that trick!"  and at once proclaimed that he woul
             d do the same thing on the next day, though in a much more natural
              way.  On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in the theater
             , but now partiality for their favorite actor very generally preva
             iled, and the audience came rather to ridicule the Countryman than
              to see the spectacle.  Both of the performers appeared on the sta
             ge.  The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and obtained, as
              on the preceding day, the applause and cheers of the spectators. 
              Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that he concealed a
              little pig beneath his clothes (which in truth he did, but not su
             spected by the audience ) contrived to take hold of and to pull hi
             s ear causing the pig to squeak.  The Crowd, however, cried out wi
             th one consent that the Buffoon had given a far more exact imitati
             on, and clamored for the Countryman to be kicked out of the theate
             r.  On this the rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and 
             showed by the most positive proof the greatness of their mistake. 
              "Look here," he said, "this shows what sort of judges you are."

mrcol        A fable by Aesop: The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass: A MILLER and
              his son were driving their Ass to a neighboring fair to sell him.
               They had not gone far when they met with a troop of women collec
             ted round a well, talking and laughing.  "Look there," cried one o
             f them, "did you ever see such fellows, to be trudging along the r
             oad on foot when they might ride?'  The old man hearing this, quic
             kly made his son mount the Ass, and continued to walk along merril
             y by his side.  Presently they came up to a group of old men in ea
             rnest debate.  "There," said one of them, "it proves what I was a-
             saying.  What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you se
             e that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk? Get down,
              you young scapegrace, and let the old man rest his weary limbs." 
              Upon this the old man made his son dismount, and got up himself. 
              In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company
              of women and children: "Why, you lazy old fellow," cried several 
             tongues at once, "how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor
              little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you?'  The g
             ood-natured Miller immediately took up his son behind him.  They h
             ad now almost reached the town.    "Pray, honest friend," said a c
             itizen, "is that Ass your own?'  "Yes," replied the old man.  "O, 
             one would not have thought so," said the other, "by the way you lo
             ad him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor bea
             st than he you."  "Anything to please you," said the old man; "we 
             can but try."  So, alighting with his son, they tied the legs of t
             he Ass together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry hi
             m on their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town. 
             This entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at i
             t, till the Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling tha
             t he was subject to, broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling 
             off the pole, fell into the river.  Upon this, the old man, vexed 
             and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that b
             y endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody, and lost 
             his Ass in the bargain.

           the prize.  Among them came a Buffoon well known among the populace 
          for his jokes, and said that he had a kind of entertainment which had

           The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any apparatus 
          or confederates, and the very sense of expectation caused an intense 
          silence.  He suddenly bent his head towards his bosom and imitated th
          e squeaking of a little pig so admirably with his voice that the audi

          cheered the actor, and loaded him with the loudest applause.  A Count
          ryman in the crowd, observing all that has passed, said, "So help me,
           Hercules, he shall not beat me at that trick!"  and at once proclaim
          ed that he would do the same thing on the next day, though in a much

          s son were driving their Ass to a neighboring fair to sell him.  They
           had not gone far when they met with a troop of women collected round
           a well, talking and laughing.  "Look there," cried one of them, "did
           you ever see such fellows, to be trudging along the road on foot whe
          n they might ride?'  The old man hearing this, quickly made his son m
          ount the Ass, and continued to walk along merrily by his side.  Prese
          ntly they came up to a group of old men in earnest debate.  "There," 
          said one of them, "it proves what I was a-saying.  What respect is sh
          own to old age in these days? Do you see that idle lad riding while h
          is old father has to walk? Get down, you young scapegrace, and let th
          e old man rest his weary limbs."  Upon this the old man made his son 
          dismount, and got up himself.  In this manner they had not proceeded 
          far when they met a company of women and children: "Why, you lazy old
           fellow," cried several tongues at once, "how can you ride upon the b
          east, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the si
          de of you?'  The good-natured Miller immediately took up his son behi
          nd him.  They had now almost reached the town.    "Pray, honest frien
          d," said a citizen, "is that Ass your own?'  "Yes," replied the old m
          an.  "O, one would not have thought so," said the other, "by the way 
          you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor 
          beast than he you."  "Anything to please you," said the old man; "we 
          can but try."  So, alighting with his son, they tied the legs of the 
          Ass together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on t
          heir shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town. This ente
          rtaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it, till the 
          Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was subjec
          t to, broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the pole, fell
           into the river.  Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed, made the
           best of his way home again, convinced that by endeavoring to please 
          everybody he had pleased nobody, and lost his Ass in the bargain.

mrcol        A fable by Aesop: The Buffoon and the Countryman : A RICH NOBLEMAN
              once opened the theaters without charge to the people, and gave a
              public notice that he would handsomely reward any person who inve
             nted a new amusement for the occasion. Various public performers c
             ontended for the prize.  Among them came a Buffoon well known amon
             g the populace for his jokes, and said that he had a kind of enter
             tainment which had never been brought out on any stage before.  Th
             is report being spread about made a great stir, and the theater wa
             s crowded in every part. The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platf
             orm, without any apparatus or confederates, and the very sense of 
             expectation caused an intense silence.  He suddenly bent his head 
             towards his bosom and imitated the squeaking of a little pig so ad
             mirably with his voice that the audience declared he had a porker 
             under his cloak, and demanded that it should be shaken out.  When 
             that was done and nothing was found, they cheered the actor, and l
             oaded him with the loudest applause.  A Countryman in the crowd, o
             bserving all that has passed, said, "So help me, Hercules, he shal
             l not beat me at that trick!"  and at once proclaimed that he woul
             d do the same thing on the next day, though in a much more natural
              way.  On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in the theater
             , but now partiality for their favorite actor very generally preva
             iled, and the audience came rather to ridicule the Countryman than
              to see the spectacle.  Both of the performers appeared on the sta
             ge.  The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and obtained, as
              on the preceding day, the applause and cheers of the spectators. 
              Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that he concealed a
              little pig beneath his clothes (which in truth he did, but not su
             spected by the audience ) contrived to take hold of and to pull hi
             s ear causing the pig to squeak.  The Crowd, however, cried out wi
             th one consent that the Buffoon had given a far more exact imitati
             on, and clamored for the Countryman to be kicked out of the theate
             r.  On this the rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and 
             showed by the most positive proof the greatness of their mistake. 
              "Look here," he said, "this shows what sort of judges you are."A 
             fable by Aesop: The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass: A MILLER and h

               ountryman : A RICH NOBLEMAN once opened the theaters without cha
               rge to the people, and gave a public notice that he would handso
               mely reward any person who invented a new amusement for the occa
               sion. Various public performers contended for the prize.  Among 
               them came a Buffoon well known among the populace for his jokes,
                and said that he had a kind of entertainment which had never be
               en brought out on any stage before.  This report being spread ab
               out made a great stir, and the theater was crowded in every part
               . The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any appa
               ratus or confederates, and the very sense of expectation caused 
               an intense silence.  He suddenly bent his head towards his bosom
                and imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably with hi
               s voice that the audience declared he had a porker under his clo
               ak, and demanded that it should be shaken out.  When that was do
               ne and nothing was found, they cheered the actor, and loaded him
                with the loudest applause.  A Countryman in the crowd, observin
               g all that has passed, said, "So help me, Hercules, he shall not
                beat me at that trick!"  and at once proclaimed that he would d
               o the same thing on the next day, though in a much more natural 
               way.  On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in the theate
               r, but now partiality for their favorite actor very generally pr
               evailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the Countryman
                than to see the spectacle.  Both of the performers appeared on 
               the stage.  The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and obt
               ained, as on the preceding day, the applause and cheers of the s
               pectators.  Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that h
