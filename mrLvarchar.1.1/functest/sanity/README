Functional tests for the mrLvarchar bladelet.


Files
~~~~~
    README   This file.
    main.sh  DBDK test harness.
    *.sql    SQL scripts.
    *.req    Baseline output.


Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Create a database, for example:

      dbaccess - -
      > create database test with log;

2) Register the mrLvarchar bladelet in that database:

      % blademgr
      92_shm>register idn_mrLvarchar.1.1 test

3) Set the TESTDB environment variable. The following shows
   C-Shell syntax:

      % setenv TESTDB test

4) Run the tests:

      % main.sh all
        regexp_extract: passed
        regexp_match: passed
        regexp_replace: passed
        regexp_split: passed

   'main.sh run' leaves *.log files in place and is useful if any
   tests fail.


-----------------------
Windows 2000 / NT Note:
-----------------------
You can run the tests in an MKS korn/bourne shell. There are two
problems that cause a diff against the baseline files to fail:

  1. Negative tests cause output to be different because IDS errors
     on Windows record a message at the end of the output; for example:

          [1] + Done(134) ?
            1748  Abort   dbaccess
     
  2. Some values are longer than the maximum 2K that MKS 'diff' can 
     handle, resulting in errors like this:

       diff: file "sblob.log": line too long: limit 2048
       diff: file "sblob.req": line too long: limit 2048

The mrLvarchar developer has been ftp'ing the Windows 2000 output
to a UNIX machine, then diff'ing the files there.
