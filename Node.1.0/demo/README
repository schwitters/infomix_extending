To run this demo:

1. Install the DataBlade on your server. As user informix:

   a. Create a new installation directory: $INFORMIXDIR/extend/Node.1.0

   b. Copy the files in the "scripts" directory to the new DataBlade 
      installation directory.

   c. Copy the shared object file (.../src/c/solaris-sparc/Node.bld) 
      to the new DataBlade installation directory.

2. In another window, where your process is set up to access your Informix
   installation, run the "main.sh" script:

     % main.sh

   After some setup steps, dbaccess is called and passed the demo.sql
   script, which contains a series of calls to the Node bladelet
   functions. The output is written to "demo.out", which is displayed
   after the script completes.
  
   Did you get the correct output? Your "demo.out" file should look
   something like the "demo.req" file in this directory.

3. When you're done, you can drop the "nodedb" database and clean up
   the demo's temp files by running the "cleanup.sh" script.
