This directory contains functional unit tests for the BWA opaque type.

Files
-----
    README      This file
    main.sh     Functional test driver
    *.sql       SQL scripts that get executed for main.sh
    *.req       Baseline files that are compared to the current run.
                The distribution includes the *.req files from
                Informix DataBlade Unit testing.  

Running
-------

Running this on NT requires the MKS toolkit, and the instructions
below work for the MKS korn shell.

Make sure that a database has already been created and that
the BWA DataBlade module has been installed in it.

Set the TESTDB env variable.

   csh syntax:

        setenv TESTDB bwatest

   ksh syntax
        TESTDB=bwatest
        export TESTDB

To test against the distributed baseline files (*.req), enter:

        main.sh all

To generate new baseline (*.req) files:

        main.sh build
        main.sh run

'run' outputs the *.log files, which are compared to the *.req using
'diff'. Review the *.log files, correct any problems, and rerun.  When
you have a good set of *.log files, save them as the new baseline by  
executing:

        main.sh save
        main.sh clean

Subsequent runs:

        main.sh all
