To run this demo:

0. This demo requires an instance of the named virtual processor class
   "IDN". Edit your $INFORMIXDIR/etc/onconfig file, and add the 
   following line to the end of it:

        VPCLASS         IDN,noyield,num=1   # some of the idn demos use this

   Now restart your server (onmode -k, followed by oninit)

1. Install the DataBlade on your server. As user informix:

   a. Create a new installation directory: $INFORMIXDIR/extend/idn_fifo.1.1

   b. Copy the files in the "scripts" directory to the new DataBlade 
      installation directory.

   c. Copy the shared object file (.../src/c/solaris-sparc/idn_fifo.bld) 
      to the new DataBlade installation directory.

2. In one window, start the FIFO server. The source, executable, and compile
   script are in the demo1/src/c directory:

     % idnFIFOServer

     FIFO server starting...
     Reading...

   The FIFO server creates a named pipe (/tmp/idn_fifo.tmp), and opens it,
   then issues a "read" call and waits for a client to write to the pipe.
     
3. In another window, where your process is set up to access your Informix
   installation, run the "main.sh" script:

     % main.sh

   After some setup steps, dbaccess is called and passed the demo.sql
   script, which contains a series of calls to the idnCallFIFO() 
   function. The output is written to "demo.out", which is displayed
   after the script completes.

   You'll also see some feedback at the FIFO server as it receives
   and responds to messages sent to it by the DataBlade.
  
   Did you get the correct output? Your "demo.out" file should look
   something like the "demo.out.sample" file in this directory.

4. You can use dbaccess or sqleditor to send your own requests to the
   FIFO server. For example:

      % dbaccess fifodb -
      execute function idnCallFIFO("This is a text string");

5. When you're done, shut down the FIFO server with ^C. You can drop the
   "fifodb" database and clean up the demo's temp files by running the
   "cleanup.sh" script.
