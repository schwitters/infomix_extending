Where am I up to:

 1. 

    Documentation needs updating.

 2. 

     Statistics and selectivity. The plan is to capture the following
	 set of values:

	 Count:
	 Number_Start_Epoch:
	 Number_Finish_Unbound:
	 Minimum_Start that is not epoch.
	 Maximum_Finish that is not open.
	 Mean_Start:
	 Mean_Finish:

	 Based on these values, it is possible to compute the selectivity of
	 the various operators, at least more accurately than the guestimates
	 the engine uses by default.

  3. 

     The aggregate is not as useful as it could be. The idea is to compute,
	 in a single pass, whether or not any overlap exists among a set of 
	 sets of periods. This may itself result in a set of periods, each of
	 which has its own.

	 SELECT T.Track,
	        Overlap_Set ( T.When )
	   FROM Train_Schedule T
	  GROUP BY T.Track;

	 Try doing this as an SPL aggregate.

  4. Nuts. The OUT Parameters in the Overlap() and OverlapWithTouches()
     appears to be broken. When you set the arg(2) to NULL, the return
	 from the SLV appears to be 0, regardless of the actual value. 

	 Possibilities: set return to -1 rather than NULL, and do log a bug
	 on this.

  5. Working on the statistics and selectivity for the DT_Period. Mostly
     working in DT_Period.c, on the DT_PeriodConsColSelectivity, and the
	 StatCollect UDFs.
